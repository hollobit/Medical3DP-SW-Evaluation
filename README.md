# Medical3DP-SW-Evaluation

It's the official repository of the EYC standard phantom for Medical 3D printing modeling software performance evaluation.

## Abstract

This project aims to develop and standardize Phantom for Medical 3D Printing Software Performance Evaluation.

## Standards and Guidelines for evaluation 

* Internation Standard 
* Domestic Standard
* MFDS Guideline

## DICOM CT Data for self-testing 

These DICOM data are open data released for self-testing. Using this data and the procedures and methods specified in the standard test methods, it is possible to evaluate the Medical 3D printing modeling SW's precision/accuracy performance.

You can check the meta information of the phantom from these DICOM fields.
