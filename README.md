## :open_file_folder: DICOM CT Data for self-testing 

These DICOM data are open data released for self-testing. Using this data and the procedures and methods specified in the standard test methods, it is possible to evaluate the Medical 3D printing modeling SW's precision/accuracy performance.

You can check the meta information of the phantom from these DICOM fields.
